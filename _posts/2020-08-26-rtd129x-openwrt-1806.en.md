This page will introduce and release the Openwrt that I ported to RTD129X devices.


## Introduction

![Status Page](/assets/images/image-20200827001529399.png)

This Openwrt usually running with Android, not standalone (I don't know what will happen if it running independently). For example, the official firmware of devices such as Zidoo X9S/Z9S/Z10 is Android + Openwrt dual system. For the convenience of description, the Openwrt I ported is named OpenwRTA (Openwrt working with Realtek Android), and the factory preset Openwrt of manufacturers such as Zidoo is named RtkWRT (Realtek's _not open_ WRT).

Comparison of each system (RtkWRT is refered on Z9S):

| | Openwrt | RtkWRT | OpenwRTA |
| ---- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| Openwrt Version | 19.07+ | 15.05.1 | 18.06.8 |
| Mounting External Rootfs or Overlayfs <sup><u>1</u></sup> | O | X | O |
| Internal Overlayfs Size | - | 40MB | 300MB+ <sup><u>2</u></sup> |
| High Performance NTFS | X | O | O |
| Displaying WIFI Information | O | X | O |
| Software Repository | Official | X | Official + Third Party |
| Transmission Streaming <sup><u>3</u></sup> | X | X | O |
| Build in Mac <sup><u>4</u></sup> | o(Part) | - | O |

* Note <sup><u>1</u></sup>: Mount Rootfs or Overlayfs from U disk

* Note <sup><u>2</u></sup>: Actual size depends on free space on eMMC, it will fall back to the official Overlay partition if there is not enough space. This value is 384MB on Z9S.

* Note <sup><u>3</u></sup>: Set a file to high priority, then the file will download progressively (beginning of file will download first), so you can watch video just wait a moment.

* Note <sup><u>4</u></sup>: Fork me on [Github](https://github.com/jjm2473/openwrt/tree/openwrt-18.06)

In addition, because the Android system is running at the same time, some of the permissions defined by the Android system will affect Openwrt. Android check permissions through GID (precisely supplementary group IDs), which leads some software must be run with a specific UID or GID in RtkWRT. OpenwRTA modified libc to automatically grant the process network access permissions and external storage device read permissions, without having to entangle the choice of UID and GID. (If a process bypasses libc to make system calls and discards its own permissions, then I can't do anything)


## Installation

0. Backup box configuration according to your own situation (including OpenWrt and Android)
1. Downlaod appropriate OTA package from [Download Section](#download). (If the Android system is 7.0 and above, download Z9S, otherwise download X9S)
4. Flash the package like normal OTA

Because OpenwRTA not using official overlay partition, so we don't need to reset configuration after flashing.

After the flashing is finished, it will restart automatically, if it appears:

1. Can not enter the Android desktop, may be incompatible, you can quickly [Rollback to Official Openwrt](#rollback)


## Rollback

If you want to quick revert to the official RtkWRT, please read this section.

First of all, make sure you are familiar with the official flash tutorial (such as [Z9S's tutorial](https://www.zidoo.tv/Support/support_guide/guide_target/jYabok9%2Ba0beq7k9e%5Bld%5D3ulg%3D%3D.html)), the rollback are similar to this, if you have operating experience, it would be better.

Prepare a U disk.

Extract squashfs1.img from the official OTA package or flash package: If it is an OTA package, the file is usually available after unzipping; if it is a flash package, rename the file to .tar suffix and extract the omv/squashfs1.img inside.

Put the extracted squashfs1.img in the root directory of the U disk.

Download [flash_squashfs1.img](/assets/files/flash_squashfs1.img), rename it to install.img, then place it in the root directory of the U disk, too.

We should have at least these files in the root directory of the U disk：
* squashfs1.img
* install.img

Turn off the device, plug in the prepared U disk, then hold the reset button, and turn it on. When the front panel displays "HELLO", you can release the reset button. After a few seconds, it will finish and reboot automatically (The screen will not Prompt flashing progress).

If it does not reboot after one minute, it should be unsuccessful. Maybe the file name is wrong. Make sure their extension is .img. (Hint: You can use WinRAR to open the disk in Windows, it will show the extension, no need to change the system settings)
