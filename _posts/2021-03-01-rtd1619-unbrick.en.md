## Unbrick with TTL/UART

First of all, we should be able to connect to the UART.

### Restore FWTABLE Signature

If you get stuck when flash before, it is likely that the signature of fwtable (similar to the partition table) is destroyed, and the machine can no longer be flashed. In this case, just restore the fwtable signature.

1. Shutdown the target device

2. Connect UART, then hold the **ESC** key in the terminal and turn the target device on, until the terminal displays `*** ESC Pressed ***` (may not be the last line) or when the terminal is no longer scrolling, then release the **ESC** key. At this time, press the **Enter** key several times it should displays `Realtek>`

3. Execution `help` in terminal, will display all supported commands, confirm whether they are included `rtkemmc`, `dw` and `mw`, if not, do not continue

4. Execution `rtkemmc read 0x03000000 20744 512` in terminal, it will load the header of fwtable to memory

5. Execution `dw 0x03000000 8`. If it says `43534552 5f5f4555`, goto next step; If it says `4f524556 5f5f414e`, it means that the signature of fwtable is ok, we don't need to touch it, we should try **Unbrick with UART + U Disk**, do not continue next step; If not either of both, I don’t know what’s going on, do not continue

6. Execution `mw 0x03000000 0x4f524556`

7. Execution `mw 0x03000004 0x5f5f414e`

8. Execution `dw 0x03000000 8`. It should displays `4f524556 5f5f414e`

9. Execution `rtkemmc write 0x03000000 20744 512`, it will write back the header to fwtable

10. Shutdown

Signature of fwtable was restored, now we can follow the official guide to flash the target device. If it still fail in flashing, then try the **Unbrick with UART + U Disk**



### Unbrick with UART + U Disk
Usually you can use this method to restore the firmware, unless uBoot is broken.

Prepare a U disk with 2GB or more space, if it is not in FAT32 format, format it as FAT32.

If you can get to this point, you must have tried the official flash tutorial ([Z9X](https://www.zidoo.tv/Support/support_guide/guide_target/x0Yfq%5Bld%5DQEAzbeq7k9e%5Bld%5D3ulg%3D%3D.html) ), I believe you already have `install.img`。
Copy the `install.img` to the root directory of the U disk.

Download [z9x_flash_rescue.zip](https://mega.nz/file/vbo3GahS#XtGkryVTk-fho4_gN9FnefjcyiOzYsMQ--9euGT2DTw), then unzip it to the root directory of the U disk.

We should have at least these files in the root directory of the U disk:

* z9x_flash_rescue.bin
* install.img

The U disk is ready.

Flash process：

1. Shutdown the target device and plug in the U disk

2. Connect UART, then hold the **ESC** key in the terminal and turn the target device on, until the terminal displays `*** ESC Pressed ***` (may not be the last line) or when the terminal is no longer scrolling, then release the **ESC** key. At this time, press the **Enter** key several times it should displays `Realtek>`, it means that you have entered the uBoot console

3. Execute `help` in terminal, will display all supported commands, confirm whether they are included `usb`, `fatload` and `boot`, if not, do not continue, try other solutions

4. Execute `usb start`, this step enables USB and scans the USB devices, it will take a few seconds, and it will display `Realtek>` on finished. Check if there is any `Storage Device(s)` found in the output. If not, change the USB slot and perform this step again

5. Execute `fatload usb 0:1 0x20000000 z9x_flash_rescue.bin`, If there was any error, change `0:1` to `0:2` `0:3` or `0:4` and try again, depending on the partition of the U disk

6. Execute `rtkemmc write 0x20000000 20744 172032000`, it will take a few moment to write emmc

7. Execute `rtkemmc erase 7704968 7737736`, it will erase boot logo, avoiding checksum verifing fail

8. Execute `boot r`, the flashing will start soon without superise



### Unbrick with UART + TFTP + U Disk
Usually you can use this method to restore the firmware, unless uBoot is broken.

Please try the "Unbrick with UART + U Disk" solution first, if  it not works, then try this.

This solution requires:
* U Disk
* Network cable (for the target machine to access TFTP)

If uBoot does not support `usb` or `fatload` commands in the "Unbrick with UART + U Disk" solution, but supports the `net` command, and `tftp` appears when the `net` command is executed, then tftp can be used to load the flashing environment.

Prepare a U disk with 2GB or more space, if it is not in FAT32 format, format it as FAT32.

Copy the `install.img` mentioned above to the root directory of the U disk so that the U disk is ready.

Prepare a TFTP server, or deploy TFTP service on the Host, Windows users refer to [this](https://gtacknowledge.extremenetworks.com/articles/How_To/How-to-install-a-TFTP-server-in-Windows), Mac users refer to [this](https://wrmem.net/index.php/2016/02/28/using-the-built-in-tftp-server-on-os-x-el-capitan/).

Download [z9x_flash_rescue.zip](https://mega.nz/file/vbo3GahS#XtGkryVTk-fho4_gN9FnefjcyiOzYsMQ--9euGT2DTw), then unzip it to the TFTP root directory. So we have `z9x_flash_rescue.bin` in TFTP root directory.

In this way, the TFTP service is also ready.


Flash process：

1. Shutdown the target device and plug in the U disk

2. Connect UART, then hold the **ESC** key in the terminal and turn the target device on, until the terminal displays `*** ESC Pressed ***` (may not be the last line) or when the terminal is no longer scrolling, then release the **ESC** key. At this time, press the **Enter** key several times it should displays `Realtek>`, it means that you have entered the uBoot console

3. Execute `help` in terminal, will display all supported commands, confirm whether they are included `net` and `boot`, if not, read the PS below

4. Configure the target network. First try DHCP automatic configuration, by execute `net dhcp_client`, it should output `DHCP client start,` wait a few seconds, if there is output `netif en ip ...`, then go to the next step; if there is no output, then manually configure the network, execute `net ifconfig <IP address> <mask> 0.0.0.0`, pay attention to replace `<IP address>` and `<mask>` with appropriate values ​​(if the TFTP server is in the internal network, it only needs to be in the same subnet as the TFTP server) (if Your TFTP service is on the external network, you need to replace `0.0.0.0` with the real gateway address, usually the router IP)

5. Execute `net ping <TFTP server IP>` (replacing `<TFTP server IP>` with the IP of the TFTP server). If the network configuration is ok, it will output multiple `ping: send ...` and `ping: recv ...`. When it is no longer outputting, press Enter to return to the console. If there is no output of `ping: recv ...`, there should be a problem with the network configuration, please solve it yourself.

6. Execute `env set tftpblocksize 1468; net tftp 0x20000000 <TFTP server IP> z9x_flash_rescue.bin` (replace `<TFTP server IP>` with the IP of the TFTP server). If there is a stuck, it may be that there is a problem with the TFTP service, or the firewall has blocked the TFTP communication. After troubleshooting these problems, you need to restart from the step 1.

7. Execute `rtkemmc write 0x20000000 20744 172032000`, it will take a few moment to write emmc

8. Execute `rtkemmc erase 7704968 7737736`, it will erase boot logo, avoiding fail on checksum verifing

9. Execute `boot r`, the flashing will start soon without superise

PS: If there is not `net` command in uBoot, but `tftp` exists, replace step 3 to 6 by execute:

   ```powershell
   env set ipaddr <IP address>
   env set serverip <TFTP server IP>
   env set tftpblocksize 1468
   tftp 0x20000000 z9x_flash_rescue.bin
   ```

PPS: If there is not `boot` command in uBoot, try `go` instead
